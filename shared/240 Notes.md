# Domain Driven Design Principles

## 1. Iterative by nature: 

    DDD is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process that evolves with the system.
    It requires continuous refinement and adaptation as the domain and requirements change.
    Design and then code.

## 2. Abstraction: 

    DDD emphasizes the use of abstractions to model complex domains.
    Abstractions help in simplifying the domain and making it more understandable.
    They allow developers to focus on high-level concepts rather than low-level details.

## 3. Naming: 

    DDD emphasizes the importance of using a common language that is shared by both developers and domain experts.
    This helps in reducing misunderstandings and ensures that everyone is on the same page.
    The use of a ubiquitous language is crucial for effective communication.

## 4. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 

    Each module or component should have a single responsibility and should not be overloaded with multiple responsibilities.
    This helps in maintaining the modularity and maintainability of the system.
